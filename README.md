# DG_1D_solver

This repository will contain firstly a matlab 1D DG solver for differents equations:
* Poisson equation with Diriclet, Neumann and mixed limit condition
* Helmotz equation with Diriclet, Neumann and mixed limit condition

This repository will also contain the theorical development associated.

Secondly, this repository will (maybe) contain the C/C++ translation of the matlab codes
